Project title and description.

Project Title: Library Management System API.

Description: Creating an API to facilitate managing Library’s books and users. It’s a library system where users can check out books, return books, and view available books. The APi will use Django ORM for database interactions and will be deployed on Heroku or PythonAnywhere to ensure accessibility.

Core features and functionality.

Here is a detailed list of what your API will do:

CRUD Operations for Books:

---

Add, view, update, and delete book records. Like Title, Author, ISBN, Published Date, Number of Copies Available.

CRUD Operations for Users:

Add, view, update, and delete user records. Like Username, Email, Date of Membership, and Active Status.

Check-out System:

View Available Books:
